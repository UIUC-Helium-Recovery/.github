## Welcome!

### Welcome Statement

Thank you for joining the Helium Recovery Program! A large group of physics-oriented researchers, technicians, accountants, and other software developers now rely upon you to maintain and improve our existing helium analytics system.

But don’t worry!

Whether you’ve been programming your entire life or not, you were chosen to support U of I’s cryogenics research for good reason. You possess the eagerness to learn and the will to work that we need to keep this tight-knit program alive and well.

So, we’re lucky to have you.

This handbook serves as a helium recovery how-to manual. In the following sections you will find system overviews, general guidelines, and ways you can improve helium recycling on the U of I campus. If you find an explanation unhelpful and would like to see a change, please do so through our GitHub Organization!

### Contacts for Help

If you run into any issues your team can’t solve or need clarification on anything, feel free to reach out to some program alumni [here](**TODO** -> insert link to program alumni file).


## Intro

### Broad Job Description

The Helium Recovery Program is a helium recycling project run under the UIUC Physics Department. We buy liquid helium from an outside vendor, ship it to customers (researchers) on campus, and then recycle the gas that returns through pipes into its pure liquid form. 

As student-workers, we are primarily tasked with:

1. tracking the return flow of helium via Raspberry PI computers,
2. analyzing our infrastructure's recycling efficiency,
3. and reporting our tracking data and analytics through the helium recovery website

For a more in-depth overview of the program, see [System Overview](#system-overview).

### Program History

If you're interested in learning more about the Helium Recovery Program's rich history on campus, visit our [physics page](https://physics.illinois.edu/research/facilities/helium-liquefier-timeline).

### Overarching Goals

Our goals here are two-fold:

1. Improve the program
2. Improve ourselves

These go hand-in-hand, with one feeding into the other. We are paid both to maintain and improve the existing helium software/hardware analytics system _and_ to teach ourselves extremely valuable software development skills. The more we learn about proper software development practices and circuitry/electronics, the better we can serve our customers (and improve our own post-grad marketability).

It's important to establish more specific goals for ourselves and the system, however, so here's the previous two goals broken down into greater detail:

1. Improve the program
    - Improve end-user experience
    - Maintain and safely enhance software system
    - Leave the overall system better than you found it
2. Improve ourselves
    - Learn more technical skills
    - Improve soft skills


As you learn more about the program and increase your technical competency, you will be sure to find opportunities to innovate our existing system. Write out your ideas, present them to your coworkers, tinker with them, prototype, and safely implement them if everyone sees fit. We have a lot of freedom to create with this job, but do so [wisely](#guidelines).

### Getting Set up

- Get on-boarded
- Get keys to Loomis and Loomis 434
- Set up cPanel Access
- Set up SSH access (explain that this is sensitive, last resort)
- Set up GitHub access
- Add yourself to the current maintainers file (create this file lmao)
